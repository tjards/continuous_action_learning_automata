# Implementaton of Continuous Action Learning Automata (CALA)This project implements Continuous Action Learning Automata (CALA) to learnan arbitrary set of actions for n-states. CALA is an on-policy Reinforcement Learning technique popular for solving stochastic optimization problems. For detailed formulations, see Reference 1.# ResultsBelow is a plot demonstrating performance for an n=3 state space with a learning rate of 0.1. Actions are constrained between -1 and 1.Note that the means converge to the correct values, variance decreases over time, and the rewards increase.<img src="results/animation_2.gif" alt="Learning Progress" width=45%><img src="results/results_2.png" alt="Results of n=3 State Space" width=45%># References1.
